# QTrobot
QTrobot is a humanoid robot created by LuxAI S.A. It has been employed for diverse applications, including emotional training for children with autism.  
This repository is a collaborative project developed by a group of 4 students from IMT Atlantique. The objective of this project is to improve the interaction between the robot and the user by implementing three functions :  
* Random Moves  
* Wikipedia Search  
* Follow user  
These functionalities contribute to creating a more immersive and interactive experience with QTrobot, fostering a sense of natural interaction and reducing the perception of robotic behavior.
